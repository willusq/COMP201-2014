= Lab 2: RPN calculator

In this lab, write a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation[RPN calculator].

== Deadline

Finish by January 27.

== Details

Whether you know it or not, you are familiar with *infix* notation in math.
In infix notation operators (e.g., +, -, *, /) are placed *in-between* operands
(numbers).
For example, infix expression `(2 + 5) * 3` evaluates to `21`, because we
evaluate the `2 + 5` first to `7`, then evaluate `7 * 3` to `21`.
Infix notation requires an order of operations (i.e., PEMDAS), or parentheses
everywhere to evaluate consistently.

Reverse polish notation (i.e., postfix notation) works differently.
In postfix, we place the operations (functions) *after* the operands.
For example, infix expression `(2 + 5) * 3` becomes postfix `2 5 + 3 *`.
Postfix does not require an order of operations or parentheses for consistent
evaluation.
Instead, we just use a stack (in our case, a `vector`, which supplies `push_back`,
`back` and `pop_back` member functions).

To evaluate `2 5 + 3 *`, we read from left to right.
We place `2` on the stack, then place `5` on the stack.
When we see the `+` operator, we pop `2` and `5` off the stack, add them, and
place the result (`7`) back on the stack.
Then, we see the value `3`; we place this on the stack.
Next, we see `*`; we pop the `3` and the `7` off the stack, and multiply.
We place the result, `21` on the stack.

== Hints

Use the algorithm described here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation#Postfix_algorithm[Postfix algorithm]

We're only dealing with integers, so use a `vector<int>` as a stack of integers.

Read in strings from `cin` the usual way, then convert a string to an integer
using the `strtol` function. The program below is an example of this.

----
#include <string>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Convert string to an integer;
    string pi = "314159";
    char *end;
    int pie;
    
    // strtol converts a string to an integer
    pie = strtol(pi.c_str(), &end, 10);
    
    cout << pie << endl;
    
    return 0;
}

== How to submit

Place your code in a file called `lab2.cpp`.
Save this file in your `COMP201-2014` folder.
Then do this:

----
cd ~/COMP201-2014             # Go into your repo
git add lab2.cpp              # Add this file to version control
git commit -m "Lab 2 is Done" # Record your change
git push origin master        # Upload your stuff to github
----
